QUESTIONS
-what is purpose of having both polygon and flag/pinpoint? would it be more user friendly (especially on mobile)  to just have flags and then ask user for approximate size of area (giving pre-set ranges; then running a script which determines whether the same query has already been made ---- i.e. if a playground is marked in the same area, the app won't make two duplicative areas, however, if a different type like a basketball court is marked, the app will allow the addition...)
